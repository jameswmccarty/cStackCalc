# cStackCalc
Simple command line equation parser written in C.

Work in progress to build / update a simple command line calculator written in C.  Credit to http://faculty.cs.niu.edu/~hutchins/csci241/eval.htm for details on infix to postfix notation.

Much of this code borrows from scraps I wrote years ago, and still needs some cleanup.
